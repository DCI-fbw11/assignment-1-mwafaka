            Antarctica's penguins are in trouble...</h1>

                    In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic
                    decline.

                    That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit
                    organization that closely monitors penguins and 
                    other<span style="color: red">Antarctic seabirds,</span>  in
                    collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in
                    New York.

                    Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660
                    sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health
                    of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and
                    gentoo. Like endangered <a href= "http://polarbearsinternational.org/" style="text-decoration:none" >polar bears</a>, penguins have come to represent
                    vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href= "polar bears">climate change.

                    The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by
                    a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years.
                    There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
                    severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to
                    changing circumstances.</p>
